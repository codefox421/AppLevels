#AppLevels

##Concept

AppLevels was born out of frustration,
the frustration of continually
adjusting the media volume on Android phones
to cope with sounds
made by other Android apps.
AppLevels manages media volumes set
for individual applications
and saves users the hassle
of adjusting the volume
every time they open a different app.

##Installation

The recommended method of installation from source
is through use of Eclipse and the
Android Development Tools (ADT) plugin.
The ADT bundle, including Eclipse,
may be downloaded from

> [http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html][adt-dl]

The [repository][repo-link] contains
the AppLevels project
without the [ActionBarSherlock][sherlock-compat-link]
compatibility library.
You will need to download and include it
([version 4.2.0][sherlock-v420-link] was
used for development, your mileage may vary
with other versions)
in order to build AppLevels.
Detailed build instructions will be included
with the first release version.
